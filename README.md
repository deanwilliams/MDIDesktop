MDIDesktop
==========

A Scrollable Multiple Document Interface Desktop for Java

Implement the two abstract classes `MDIDesktopAbstractController` and `MDIDesktopAbstractView` and then extend `MDIDesktopFrame` to build your own Internal Frames. Don't forget to `setBounds()` on your internal frames otherwise they won't be visible!
